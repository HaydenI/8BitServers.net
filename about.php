        <h1>About</h1>
        <p class="lead">
            It all started when I was two years old. My Dad owned a classic Dell computer running Windows 98. Before going to work he taught me how to do the most simple of all actions on the computer, changing the desktop background. After he left for work, he came back home to me sitting at the computer with the background changed from the one he left with. He knew this was the start of my life.
            <p class="lead">
                Ever since then, I have been intrigued on how computers work and interact with each other. Also I have been fascinated with the idea of owning my very own LLC. This lead to where I am today, working for my self and with networks/computers of all types.
